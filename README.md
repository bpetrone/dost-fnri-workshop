## Get started

### Take pre-workshop survey

### Install RStudio

### Download the workshop materials

You can copy the full contents of this repository to your personal computer by "cloning" them. A common reason to clone public remote repositories is to install software that is published as a repository. Cloning a repository differs from downloading in that there is still a connection to the remote copy (*i.e.* on GitHub) that you've copied from. This means that if changes happen in the repository, you can run a second command, called a "pull", to update them in your local version as well.

## How to clone the workshop repository:

1.  In a web browser, go to the [workshop repository on GitHub](XX%20update%20link).
2.  Click on the blue **Clone** button in the top right part of the repository page.
3.  A dialog box will pop up that says "Clone with SSH", "Clone with HTTPS", etc.
4.  In this case you will want "Clone with HTTPS", so click on the clipboard icon to copy the URL.
5.  In RStudio click on the **File** menu, then select **New Project**.
6.  Choose **Version Control** in the *Create Project* dialog box.
7.  Choose **Git** in the *Create Project from Version Control* dialog box.
8.  Paste the repository URL you just copied into the *Repository URL* box.
9.  For *Project directory name* you will generally want to use the repo name.
10. For *Create project as subdirectory of:* click on the **Browse** button
11. In the *Choose Directory* dialog that opens, click on **Home** then **New Folder**
12. In the *New Folder* dialog box type "workshop", then click **OK**.
13. Now in the *Choose Directory* dialog click **Choose**
14. Now that you are back in the *Clone Git Repository* dialog, click **Create Project**.
