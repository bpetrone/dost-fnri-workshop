# Hands-on

This folder contains materials for the hands-on workshop sessions.

## Overview

-   **data** contains two example datasets (16S and *trnL*) that we'll use in the workshop sessions
-   **Hands-on** contains R code notebooks for doing XX

## Additional details

The 16S dataset comes from [QIIME2's "Moving Pictures" tutorial](https://docs.qiime2.org/2022.8/tutorials/moving-pictures/)
The *trnL* dataset comes from our lab. We won't actively use this in the workshop sessions, but you can revisit and step through all the same steps as we've done here with 16S.
